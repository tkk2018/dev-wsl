## Migrate between two distro apps

Follow [this](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-16-04-end-of-life-on-wsl-migrating-to-newer-versions/22277) to migrate all the user data and installed applications to another ubuntu app.

> Note that upgrading the operating system version of a specific Ubuntu distribution installed on WSL will not change the name of the app which includes the version. This may cause confusion and inconsistency. For example, if you have "Ubuntu 18.04" app installed from the Microsoft Store and you upgrade it to 20.04, the name of the app will still be "Ubuntu 18.04".

> To avoid this issue, you can migrate all your user data and installed applications to a new Ubuntu distribution on WSL that matches the OS version you want.
